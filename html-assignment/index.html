    <p>My name is Mouad and I am 28 years of age. I come from Morocco, a beautiful country of deserts, snow and the ocean. I used to be a graphic designer, therefore, creativity has always been at the center of what I do with my life. I love to combine colors and shapes into beautiful pieces of art which tell a story.
 Because of my profession, I happen to love animals and particularly dogs and cats. I also keep myself busy with the gym, swimming, and traveling for which I draw inspiration from.
 The IMD program stands out to me because I want to learn more about creativity and enhance my ability to use design to address issues that exist in the world.
